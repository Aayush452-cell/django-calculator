For Devlopment:

1) Fork the repo to your account
2) Clone it in your system
3) Then install all the requirements using command `pip freeze > requirements.txt`
4) Then run the commands:-
   * `python manage.py makemigrations`

   Note - These commands are used to create all the necessary schemas in your database and to migrate all the changes in models.
5) To run the app in your local environment run the command :- `python manage.py runserver`
6) Now you can see your local environment running at `localhost:8000`

For Deployement:

1) I have used `Heroku`

To see the web app in action you can use these credentials :

You can also create your own admin username and password by creating a new superuser and to do so just run this command 
`python manage.py createsuperuser`
